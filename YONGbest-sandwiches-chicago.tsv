1.	 BLT	Old Oak Tap	The B is applewood smoked—nice and snappy. The L is arugula—fresh and peppery. The T is a fried green slice—jacketed in cornmeal and greaseless.

4.	 Roast Beef	Al’s Deli	The Francophile brothers behind this deli, which has been in the family for 63 years, have turned simple ingredients into a sophisticated sandwich that balances savory and sweet: just rare roast beef, fresh tomato, Swiss cheese, and homemade béarnaise sauce on a buttery croissant.	$9.40	914 Noyes St., Evanston, Chicago	847-475-9400	alsdeli.net
5.	 PB&amp;L	Publican Quality Meats	When this place opened in February, it quickly rose to the top tier with its refined roster of sandwiches. Take, for instance, the one with grilled housemade pork belly and lamb sausage. It’s sprinkled with feta, cilantro, and sweet and spicy pipérade and tucked into a toasted, buttered lobster roll. It’s like the quarterback on a team packed with future Hall-of-Famers.	$10	825 W. Fulton Mkt., Chicago	312-445-8977	publicanqualitymeats.com

7.	 Lobster Roll	Acadia	In a town that recently discovered the joys of lobster rolls, nobody does them better than Ryan McCaskey.

From the Atlantic to your belly in 24 hours.	$16	1639 S. Wabash Ave., Chicago	312-360-9500	acadiachicago.com
8.	 Smoked Salmon Salad	Birchwood Kitchen	Birchwood’s sandwich-slinging virtuosos consistently wow us with their seasonal menus. This time around, they’ve put a fallish slant on salmon salad, adding subtle notes of squash, red onion, sage, and chopped arugula to the mix and smooshing it inside a buttery, toasted sesame bagel.	$10	2211 W. North Ave., Chicago	773-276-2100	birchwoodkitchen.com
9.	 Atomica Cemitas	Cemitas Puebla	Standing three inches high, the Atomica is something to behold.

For an extra kick, sprinkle salsa over the multitiered meat fiesta.	$9	3619 W. North Ave., Chicago	773-772-8435	cemitaspuebla.com
10.	 Grilled Laughing Bird Shrimp and Fried Oyster Po’ Boy	Nana	"Grilled Laughing Bird shrimp and fried oyster po’ boy, Nana<br/>
	Will it be shrimp? Or, gee, the oysters? In Cajun country, you are forced to choose. So bless Bridgeport, where the friendly organic joint Nana packs a meal-and-a-half-size baguette with both—grilled Laughing Bird shrimp, perfectly fried oysters—and, for good Midwestern measure, adds housemade giardiniera."	$17	3267 S. Halsted St., Chicago	312-929-2486	nanaorganic.com
11.	 Ham and Raclette Panino	Lula Cafe	A crusty ciabatta bun is a flavorsome sponge for oozing Swiss cheese, rich egg yolk, and mustard with sweet-and-sour bursts of black currant. Smoky cured ham seals the deal.	$11	2537 N. Kedzie Blvd., Chicago	773-489-9554	lulacafe.com
12.	 Breaded Steak	Ricobene’s	This is what put Ricobene’s on the map: breaded skirt steak topped with housemade meat sauce on a crusty Turano French roll and finished with your choice of cheese and peppers.

13.	 The Hawkeye	Frog n Snail	We didn’t expect a <em>Man v. Food–</em>esque behemoth on Dale Levitski’s menu, but there it was: a shiny egg bun dripping grease from its delectable pan-fried and ground pork innards. And ten minutes later, there it wasn’t.	$14	3124 N. Broadway, Chicago	773-661-9166	frognsnail.com
14.	 Chicken Dip	Crosby’s Kitchen	Luscious nuggets of white meat from the kitchen’s rotisserie stand in for the French dip’s usual fatty beef.

Southport Ave., Chicago	773-883-2525	crosbyskitchenchicago.com
15.	Longman &amp; Eagle Wild Boar Sloppy Joe	Longman & Eagle	With its toasted brioche, peppery pickled jalapeños, crispy onions, and fried sage, this Joe is a man-size wowzer spilling over with tender, spicy ground boar.

Best	Sandwiches in Chicago: Bari Meatball Sub	Bari	No condiments, no fuss, just saucy meatballs (from the owners’ 80-year-old family recipe) on a crunchy Upper Crust roll, provolone optional. Sure, this Italian-heavy stretch of Grand Avenue is paved with meatballs—but at lunch the line starts and ends here.	$4.50	1120 W. Grand Ave., Chicago	312-666-0730	bariitaliansubs.com
17.	 Corned Beef	Manny’s	The most famous deli sandwich in Chicago is also the gold standard: a sliced-to-order spectacle of salty-sweet meat that’s so tender, juicy, and lean you’ll savor it, sans the mild rye or the mustard, using only your fork.	$11.95	1141 S. Jefferson St., Chicago	312-939-2855	mannysdeli.com
18.	 Turkey Club	Eggy’s	Cut in quarters and stabbed with cellophaned toothpicks, this turkey club on whole-wheat toast gets everything right, especially the thick slices of juicy turkey.

19.	 Falafel	Old Jerusalem	The fritters of mashed chickpeas are perfectly cooked and seasoned—no burnt balls here. Fresh tomatoes and lettuce and creamy tahini sauce only add to the tastiness.	$6.25	1411 N. Wells St., Chicago	312-944-0459	oldjerusalemchicago.com
20.	 Crab Cake	Mindy’s HotChocolate	The whole sassy crew at HotChocolate agrees there’s nothing finer than a chilled white with seafood, so look to a glass of crisp <strong>2008 Koehler-Ruprecht pinot blanc</strong> ($15) to enhance the crab’s flavor.	$15	1747 N. Damen Ave., Chicago	773-489-1747	hotchocolatechicago.com

Irving Park Rd., Chicago	773-539-8038	
22.	 Shawarma	Dawali Mediterranean Kitchen	Dawali’s filling shawarma escapes a common problem—the seasoned lamb-beef combo is in just the right proportion to the tahini sauce, greens, cucumbers, and pita bread.	$5	3209 W. Irving Park Rd., Chicago	773-539-8038	dawalikitchen.com
23.	 Toasted Pimiento Cheese	Big Jones	Not the gooiest but definitely the kickiest grilled cheese around, thanks to the genius who thought to melt local heirloom pimientos right into the tangy cheddar. Chow-chow made with sautéed onions, cabbage, and peppers adds to the glow it leaves in your mouth. You’ll fall for the toasted marbled rye, too.	$8	5347 N. Clark St., Chicago	773-275-5725	bigjoneschicago.com
24.	 Vegetarian Panino	La Pane	La Pane might be known for pizza, but it offers a veggie panino with a punch. The power is in the piquant green pesto, made from peppers imported from Serbia, which is also delish on a freshly baked croissant.	$5.99	2954 W. Irving Park Rd., Chicago	773-539-5321	lapanechicago.com
25.	 Cali Chèvre	Pastoral	Sometimes you come across a sandwich with a combination of fillings so wacky it works. For example, why would anyone put avocado, goat cheese, spiced almond butter, celery, and red onions on a baguette? We love it—whatever the reason.	$5.99	2954 W. Irving Park Rd., Chicago	773-539-5321	pastoralartisan.com
26.	 Pastrami	Max’s Deli	Pastrami is the bacon of deli meats—a succulent, salty guilty pleasure that’s rarely described as lean. Max’s must have a surgeon working in the kitchen because we’ve never seen pastrami this svelte and tender. And the juice from the warm meat soaks into the chewy rye bread.	$11.95	191 Skokie Valley Rd., Highland Park, Chicago	847-831-0600	maxs-deli.com
27.	 The Fredo	Lucky’s Sandwich Co.	This hulk—which stacks copious amounts of coleslaw and salty skin-on fries over layers of Italian deli meats and cold provolone on white—admits very few to the Clean Plate Club.	$11.95	191 Skokie Valley Rd., Highland Park, Chicago	847-831-0600	luckysandwich.com

Wilson Ave., Chicago	773-293-2489	cityprovisions.com
29.	 Jibarito	Papa’s Cache Sabroso	Two razor-thin fried plantains—crispy, not starchy—hold in place the sweet grilled onions, well-seasoned strips of beef, and a white cheese mild enough not to overwhelm a lilt of garlic. It’s a true original: a cheesesteak-inspired jibarito.	$7	2517 W. Division St., Chicago	773-862-8313	papascachesabroso.com
30.	Bavette’s Bar &amp; Boeuf Shaved Prime Rib	Bavette’s Bar & Boeuf	“Our <strong>Lillet Rose martini</strong> [$12] is a great apéritif to begin any meal,” says bar manager Amie Autenrieth. “It’s clean and crisp, floral and fruity, but the Lillet gives it depth. We came up with it because not everyone wants brown spirits.”	$21	218 W. Kinzie St., Chicago	312-624-8154	
31.	 Serrano Ham and Manchego Cheese	Hannah’s Bretzel	A perpetually jammed workday lunch stop has no right turning out such beautifully marbled sliced-to-order ham. Nor should it top said ham with such thick and tasty fig chutney and encase it in an ultrafresh pretzel baguette.	$21	218 W. Kinzie St., Chicago	312-624-8154	hannahsbretzel.com
32.	 Tuna Salad	La Fournette	Pierre Zimmermann claims to be a fourth-generation French baker. One bite of his housemade multigrain baguette laced with flax, sunflower, sesame, and pumpkin seeds convinced us. Glad he’s not too proud to stuff it with a light and creamy tuna salad with sprouts and capers.	$9.75	1547 N. Wells St., Chicago	312-624-9430	lafournette.com
33.	 Paramount Reuben	Paramount Room	Briny lean brisket, kraut, and melted Gruyère neatly packaged between two thick slices of toasted marble rye can be a mighty attractive alternative to the classic mountain of corned beef.	$13	415 N. Milwaukee Ave., Chicago	312-829-6300	paramountroom.com
34.	 The Istanbul	Melt Sandwich Shoppe	Sweet figs, salt-speckled bread, and smoky Gouda are an answered prayer from the lunch gods. As is the price of this oversize, splittable Turkish delight.	$7.95	1840 N. Damen Ave., Chicago	773-681-9914	meltsandwichshoppechicago.com
35.	Floriole Cafe &amp; Bakery B.A.D.	Floriole Cafe & Bakery	The silky smooth almond-date spread makes this a standout. No, wait, it’s that perfect bacon. Actually, it could be the wonderfully grainy housemade cornmeal bread. Whatever. This sandwich doesn’t live up to its name.	$9	1220 W. Webster Ave., Chicago	773-883-1313	floriole.com
36.	 Duck Confit and Mozzarella	First Slice Pie Café	Duck is not your typical sandwich meat, but First Slice’s panino—a wonderland of blistery mozzarella, mushrooms, grilled red onions, and sun-dried tomato spread—overflows with hunks and slivers of duck confit. Ethereal and glorious.	$9	5357 N. Ashland Ave., Chicago	773-275-4297	firstslice.org
37.	 Croque Monsieur	Troquet	Not fair that Parisians are so famously skinny, with grilled cheese like this at their disposal—hefty with ham, oozy with Swiss and béchamel, a feast on crusty sourdough bread. With frites, bien sûr.	$8	1834 W. Montrose Ave., Chicago	773-334-5664	troquetchicago.com
38.	 Green Garbanzo	Grahamwich	With chewy strips of preserved lemon rind, moist couscous studded with bright garbanzo beans and pine nuts, and a squishy flatbread encasement, this vegetarian pick has serious star power. Just like Graham Elliot, the splashy chef who oversees the joint.	$8	615 N. State St., Chicago	312-265-0434	grahamwich.com
39.	 The Hen House	Saigon Sisters	Caramelized chunks of dark and white meat chicken meld with a lemongrass-ginger marinade, and the ever-important baguette attains the flawless combo of chewy and crusty, ensuring that this banh mi rules the roost.	$8	615 N. State St., Chicago	312-265-0434	saigonsisters.com
40.	 Tuscan Chicken	Rosalia’s Deli	When a boneless chicken breast is dripping with jus, somebody did something right. It’s crammed into a grilled sourdough roll from Biondillo Bakery along with mushrooms, roasted red peppers, and pesto ranch dressing. Damn right.	$6	241 N. York Rd., Elmhurst, Chicago	630-516-3354	rosaliasdeli.com
41.	Z&amp;H MarketCafe The Marty	Z&H MarketCafe	The generous application of muhammara—a zesty Middle Eastern spread involving peppers, ground walnuts, and pomegranate molasses—elevates this panino of grilled eggplant and tomatoes with Muenster cheese on herbed focaccia.	$7.25	1323 E. 57th St., Chicago	773-538-7372	zhmarketcafe.com
42.	 Whitefish	Market House on the Square	Could a sandwich sound more unsexy? Hardly. But this thick, juicy breaded fillet—all dolled up with sweet chili vinaigrette, shallots, and basil—is a player. Ditto for the irresistible fries.	$11	655 Forest Ave., Lake Forest, Chicago	847-234-8800	themarkethouse.com
43.	 Oat Bread, Pecan Butter, and Fruit Jam	Elaine’s Coffee Call	The chalkboard menu is ambiguous about whether this pressed-to-order snack (in which housemade jam crafted from Green City Market fruit seeps from between freshly baked oat bread) is meant for breakfast or lunch, so we’ll just order it every time we’re in the neighborhood.	$6	Hotel Lincoln, 1816 N. Clark St., Chicago	312-254-4665	jdvhotels.com/hotels/chicago/lincoln
44.	 Cauliflower Melt	Marion Street Cheese Market	Who says veggie sandwiches are healthy? This beefy number is indulgent and delightfully greasy. Thick browned cauliflower drips with zippy cheddar and plentiful curry aïoli; soak it (and your guilt) up with toasted multigrain bread.	$9	100 S. Marion St., Oak Park, Chicago	708-725-7200	marionstreetcheesemarket.com
45.	 Cubano	Cafecito	The success of this sandwich, a Cuban tradition with shredded pork, glazed ham, Swiss cheese, yellow mustard, and pickles, rests with the bread. Cafecito’s simple white slices are crisp around the edges and spongy within: perfect bookends for a grilled sandwich.	$5.49	26 E. Congress Pkwy., Chicago	312-922-2233	cafecitochicago.com
46.	 Kufta	Chickpea	Nestled within the freshest, chewiest pita pocket our teeth have ever met, twin logs of impeccably spiced ground lamb and beef mingle with grill-marked tomatoes, green peppers, and onions. With a crown of smooth tahini sauce, it’s a kebab fit for a sheikh.	$8	2018 W. Chicago Ave., Chicago	773-384-9930	chickpeaonthego.com
47.	 Debbie’s Egg Salad	The Goddess and Grocer	Nothing quite satisfies the comfortfood hunger like some unfussy egg salad on multigrain toast. With no more than a dash of salt, a sprinkle of pepper, and a dollop of Dijon, this one is a testament to the sheer power of simplicity.	$6.50	25 E. Delaware Pl., Chicago	312-896-2600	goddessandgrocer.com
48.

49.	 Le Végétarien	Toni Patisserie	Toni Cox spreads rich white bean hummus on a baguette and loads it up with soft roasted red peppers, baby spinach, red onions, and a splash of tomato vinaigrette. Standard veggie fare? Perhaps. But when the components soak into the bread, this sandwich becomes epic.	$8.75	65 E. Washington St., Chicago	312-726-2020	tonipatisserie.com
50.	 The Gatsby	Phoebe’s Bakery	The best thing about Phoebe’s panini is the crunchy multigrain bread. Steer clear of the cheese-heavy varieties and go for the Gatsby, with roasted chicken, provolone, and a lovely, light pesto mayo dipping sauce.	$6.85	3351 N. Broadway, Chicago	773-868-4000	phoebesbakery.com
