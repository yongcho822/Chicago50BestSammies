4.	 Roast Beef	Al’s Deli	The Francophile brothers behind this deli, which has been in the family for 63 years, have turned simple ingredients into a sophisticated sandwich that balances savory and sweet: just rare roast beef, fresh tomato, Swiss cheese, and homemade béarnaise sauce on a buttery croissant.	$9.40	914 Noyes St., Evanston, Chicago	847-475-9400	alsdeli.net	914 Noyes Street, Evanston, IL 60201, USA	42.0583217	-87.6837479
5.	 PB&amp;L	Publican Quality Meats	When this place opened in February, it quickly rose to the top tier with its refined roster of sandwiches. Take, for instance, the one with grilled housemade pork belly and lamb sausage. It’s sprinkled with feta, cilantro, and sweet and spicy pipérade and tucked into a toasted, buttered lobster roll. It’s like the quarterback on a team packed with future Hall-of-Famers.	$10	825 W.

7.	 Lobster Roll	Acadia	In a town that recently discovered the joys of lobster rolls, nobody does them better than Ryan McCaskey.

8.	 Smoked Salmon Salad	Birchwood Kitchen	Birchwood’s sandwich-slinging virtuosos consistently wow us with their seasonal menus.

North Ave., Chicago	773-276-2100	birchwoodkitchen.com	2211 West North Avenue, Chicago, IL 60647, USA	41.9101749	-87.6828797
9.	 Atomica Cemitas	Cemitas Puebla	Standing three inches high, the Atomica is something to behold.

10.	 Grilled Laughing Bird Shrimp and Fried Oyster Po’ Boy	Nana	"Grilled Laughing Bird shrimp and fried oyster po’ boy, Nana<br/>
	Will it be shrimp? Or, gee, the oysters? In Cajun country, you are forced to choose. So bless Bridgeport, where the friendly organic joint Nana packs a meal-and-a-half-size baguette with both—grilled Laughing Bird shrimp, perfectly fried oysters—and, for good Midwestern measure, adds housemade giardiniera."	$17	3267 S.

11.	 Ham and Raclette Panino	Lula Cafe	A crusty ciabatta bun is a flavorsome sponge for oozing Swiss cheese, rich egg yolk, and mustard with sweet-and-sour bursts of black currant. Smoky cured ham seals the deal.	$11	2537 N. Kedzie Blvd., Chicago	773-489-9554	lulacafe.com	2537 North Kedzie Boulevard, Chicago, IL 60647, USA	41.9269438	-87.7072611

13.	 The Hawkeye	Frog n Snail	We didn’t expect a <em>Man v. Food–</em>esque behemoth on Dale Levitski’s menu, but there it was: a shiny egg bun dripping grease from its delectable pan-fried and ground pork innards. And ten minutes later, there it wasn’t.	$14	3124 N. Broadway, Chicago	773-661-9166	frognsnail.com	3124 North Broadway, Chicago, IL 60657, USA	41.9384576	-87.64437679999999
14.	 Chicken Dip	Crosby’s Kitchen	Luscious nuggets of white meat from the kitchen’s rotisserie stand in for the French dip’s usual fatty beef.

15.	Longman &amp; Eagle Wild Boar Sloppy Joe	Longman & Eagle	With its toasted brioche, peppery pickled jalapeños, crispy onions, and fried sage, this Joe is a man-size wowzer spilling over with tender, spicy ground boar.

Best	Sandwiches in Chicago: Bari Meatball Sub	Bari	No condiments, no fuss, just saucy meatballs (from the owners’ 80-year-old family recipe) on a crunchy Upper Crust roll, provolone optional.

17.	 Corned Beef	Manny’s	The most famous deli sandwich in Chicago is also the gold standard: a sliced-to-order spectacle of salty-sweet meat that’s so tender, juicy, and lean you’ll savor it, sans the mild rye or the mustard, using only your fork.	$11.95	1141 S. Jefferson St., Chicago	312-939-2855	mannysdeli.com	1141 South Jefferson Street, Chicago, IL 60607, USA	41.86778899999999	-87.64192729999999
18.	 Turkey Club	Eggy’s	Cut in quarters and stabbed with cellophaned toothpicks, this turkey club on whole-wheat toast gets everything right, especially the thick slices of juicy turkey.

20.	 Crab Cake	Mindy’s HotChocolate	The whole sassy crew at HotChocolate agrees there’s nothing finer than a chilled white with seafood, so look to a glass of crisp <strong>2008 Koehler-Ruprecht pinot blanc</strong> ($15) to enhance the crab’s flavor.	$15	1747 N.

21.

23.	 Toasted Pimiento Cheese	Big Jones	Not the gooiest but definitely the kickiest grilled cheese around, thanks to the genius who thought to melt local heirloom pimientos right into the tangy cheddar. Chow-chow made with sautéed onions, cabbage, and peppers adds to the glow it leaves in your mouth. You’ll fall for the toasted marbled rye, too.	$8	5347 N. Clark St., Chicago	773-275-5725	bigjoneschicago.com	5347 North Clark Street, Chicago, IL 60640, USA	41.9794385	-87.6680092
24.	 Vegetarian Panino	La Pane	La Pane might be known for pizza, but it offers a veggie panino with a punch. The power is in the piquant green pesto, made from peppers imported from Serbia, which is also delish on a freshly baked croissant.	$5.99	2954 W. Irving Park Rd., Chicago	773-539-5321	lapanechicago.com	2954 West Irving Park Road, Chicago, IL 60618, USA	41.9540244	-87.7025206
25.	 Cali Chèvre	Pastoral	Sometimes you come across a sandwich with a combination of fillings so wacky it works. For example, why would anyone put avocado, goat cheese, spiced almond butter, celery, and red onions on a baguette? We love it—whatever the reason.	$5.99	2954 W. Irving Park Rd., Chicago	773-539-5321	pastoralartisan.com	2954 West Irving Park Road, Chicago, IL 60618, USA	41.9540244	-87.7025206
26.	 Pastrami	Max’s Deli	Pastrami is the bacon of deli meats—a succulent, salty guilty pleasure that’s rarely described as lean. Max’s must have a surgeon working in the kitchen because we’ve never seen pastrami this svelte and tender. And the juice from the warm meat soaks into the chewy rye bread.	$11.95	191 Skokie Valley Rd., Highland Park, Chicago	847-831-0600	maxs-deli.com	Crossroads Shopping Center, 191 Skokie Valley Road, Highland Park, IL 60035, USA	42.1567073	-87.8036345
27.	 The Fredo	Lucky’s Sandwich Co.	This hulk—which stacks copious amounts of coleslaw and salty skin-on fries over layers of Italian deli meats and cold provolone on white—admits very few to the Clean Plate Club.	$11.95	191 Skokie Valley Rd., Highland Park, Chicago	847-831-0600	luckysandwich.com

29.	 Jibarito	Papa’s Cache Sabroso	Two razor-thin fried plantains—crispy, not starchy—hold in place the sweet grilled onions, well-seasoned strips of beef, and a white cheese mild enough not to overwhelm a lilt of garlic. It’s a true original: a cheesesteak-inspired jibarito.	$7	2517 W. Division St., Chicago	773-862-8313	papascachesabroso.com			
30.	Bavette’s Bar &amp; Boeuf Shaved Prime Rib	Bavette’s Bar & Boeuf	“Our <strong>Lillet Rose martini</strong> [$12] is a great apéritif to begin any meal,” says bar manager Amie Autenrieth. “It’s clean and crisp, floral and fruity, but the Lillet gives it depth. We came up with it because not everyone wants brown spirits.”	$21	218 W. Kinzie St., Chicago	312-624-8154				
31.	 Serrano Ham and Manchego Cheese	Hannah’s Bretzel	A perpetually jammed workday lunch stop has no right turning out such beautifully marbled sliced-to-order ham. Nor should it top said ham with such thick and tasty fig chutney and encase it in an ultrafresh pretzel baguette.	$21	218 W. Kinzie St., Chicago	312-624-8154	hannahsbretzel.com			
32.	 Tuna Salad	La Fournette	Pierre Zimmermann claims to be a fourth-generation French baker. One bite of his housemade multigrain baguette laced with flax, sunflower, sesame, and pumpkin seeds convinced us. Glad he’s not too proud to stuff it with a light and creamy tuna salad with sprouts and capers.	$9.75	1547 N. Wells St., Chicago	312-624-9430	lafournette.com	1547 North Wells Street, Chicago, IL 60610, USA	41.9105233	-87.63434559999999
33.	 Paramount Reuben	Paramount Room	Briny lean brisket, kraut, and melted Gruyère neatly packaged between two thick slices of toasted marble rye can be a mighty attractive alternative to the classic mountain of corned beef.	$13	415 N. Milwaukee Ave., Chicago	312-829-6300	paramountroom.com	415 North Milwaukee Avenue, Chicago, IL 60654, USA	41.8896243	-87.644853
34.	 The Istanbul	Melt Sandwich Shoppe	Sweet figs, salt-speckled bread, and smoky Gouda are an answered prayer from the lunch gods. As is the price of this oversize, splittable Turkish delight.	$7.95	1840 N. Damen Ave., Chicago	773-681-9914	meltsandwichshoppechicago.com	1840 North Damen Avenue, Chicago, IL 60647, USA	41.9150939	-87.6777957
35.	Floriole Cafe &amp; Bakery B.A.D.	Floriole Cafe & Bakery	The silky smooth almond-date spread makes this a standout. No, wait, it’s that perfect bacon. Actually, it could be the wonderfully grainy housemade cornmeal bread. Whatever. This sandwich doesn’t live up to its name.	$9	1220 W. Webster Ave., Chicago	773-883-1313	floriole.com	1220 West Webster Avenue, Chicago, IL 60614, USA	41.9218346	-87.65919919999999
36.	 Duck Confit and Mozzarella	First Slice Pie Café	Duck is not your typical sandwich meat, but First Slice’s panino—a wonderland of blistery mozzarella, mushrooms, grilled red onions, and sun-dried tomato spread—overflows with hunks and slivers of duck confit. Ethereal and glorious.	$9	5357 N. Ashland Ave., Chicago	773-275-4297	firstslice.org	5357 North Ashland Avenue, Chicago, IL 60640, USA	41.97969	-87.66940439999999
37.	 Croque Monsieur	Troquet	Not fair that Parisians are so famously skinny, with grilled cheese like this at their disposal—hefty with ham, oozy with Swiss and béchamel, a feast on crusty sourdough bread. With frites, bien sûr.	$8	1834 W. Montrose Ave., Chicago	773-334-5664	troquetchicago.com	1834 West Montrose Avenue, Chicago, IL 60613, USA	41.9617726	-87.67582349999999
38.	 Green Garbanzo	Grahamwich	With chewy strips of preserved lemon rind, moist couscous studded with bright garbanzo beans and pine nuts, and a squishy flatbread encasement, this vegetarian pick has serious star power. Just like Graham Elliot, the splashy chef who oversees the joint.	$8	615 N. State St., Chicago	312-265-0434	grahamwich.com	615 North State Street, Chicago, IL 60654, USA	41.89296119999999	-87.6278214
39.	 The Hen House	Saigon Sisters	Caramelized chunks of dark and white meat chicken meld with a lemongrass-ginger marinade, and the ever-important baguette attains the flawless combo of chewy and crusty, ensuring that this banh mi rules the roost.	$8	615 N. State St., Chicago	312-265-0434	saigonsisters.com	615 North State Street, Chicago, IL 60654, USA	41.89296119999999	-87.6278214
40.	 Tuscan Chicken	Rosalia’s Deli	When a boneless chicken breast is dripping with jus, somebody did something right. It’s crammed into a grilled sourdough roll from Biondillo Bakery along with mushrooms, roasted red peppers, and pesto ranch dressing. Damn right.	$6	241 N. York Rd., Elmhurst, Chicago	630-516-3354	rosaliasdeli.com	241 South York Road, Bensenville, IL 60106, USA	41.9512694	-87.93956519999999
41.	Z&amp;H MarketCafe The Marty	Z&H MarketCafe	The generous application of muhammara—a zesty Middle Eastern spread involving peppers, ground walnuts, and pomegranate molasses—elevates this panino of grilled eggplant and tomatoes with Muenster cheese on herbed focaccia.	$7.25	1323 E. 57th St., Chicago	773-538-7372	zhmarketcafe.com	1323 East 57th Street, Chicago, IL 60637, USA	41.7912136	-87.5938887
42.	 Whitefish	Market House on the Square	Could a sandwich sound more unsexy? Hardly. But this thick, juicy breaded fillet—all dolled up with sweet chili vinaigrette, shallots, and basil—is a player. Ditto for the irresistible fries.	$11	655 Forest Ave., Lake Forest, Chicago	847-234-8800	themarkethouse.com	655 Forest Avenue, Lake Forest, IL 60045, USA	42.251828	-87.84132199999999
43.	 Oat Bread, Pecan Butter, and Fruit Jam	Elaine’s Coffee Call	The chalkboard menu is ambiguous about whether this pressed-to-order snack (in which housemade jam crafted from Green City Market fruit seeps from between freshly baked oat bread) is meant for breakfast or lunch, so we’ll just order it every time we’re in the neighborhood.	$6	Hotel Lincoln, 1816 N. Clark St., Chicago	312-254-4665	jdvhotels.com/hotels/chicago/lincoln	1816 North Clark Street, Chicago, IL 60614, USA	41.9152646	-87.6344515

45.	 Cubano	Cafecito	The success of this sandwich, a Cuban tradition with shredded pork, glazed ham, Swiss cheese, yellow mustard, and pickles, rests with the bread. Cafecito’s simple white slices are crisp around the edges and spongy within: perfect bookends for a grilled sandwich.	$5.49	26 E. Congress Pkwy., Chicago	312-922-2233	cafecitochicago.com	26 East Congress Parkway, Chicago, IL 60605, USA	41.8758037	-87.62636599999999
46.	 Kufta	Chickpea	Nestled within the freshest, chewiest pita pocket our teeth have ever met, twin logs of impeccably spiced ground lamb and beef mingle with grill-marked tomatoes, green peppers, and onions.

47.	 Debbie’s Egg Salad	The Goddess and Grocer	Nothing quite satisfies the comfortfood hunger like some unfussy egg salad on multigrain toast.

49.	 Le Végétarien	Toni Patisserie	Toni Cox spreads rich white bean hummus on a baguette and loads it up with soft roasted red peppers, baby spinach, red onions, and a splash of tomato vinaigrette.
